# T3-SP: short period and static longitudinal stability (SAS off)

Method: skill `f104-testcard` incl. 2b. Tool `tools/pitch_step_test.py` (stabilizer step ±0.2° through the trim, AP off,
α at ≈ 20 Hz, fit of ωn/ζ, α/δ from the fit asymptote). Found during H1 (pitch damper, card H1-sas.md).

## Objective / acceptance
Short period SAS off vs. NASA (CR-2144 Table III-3/III-5 SAS off, CG 0.07 c̄, 16 300 lb; CR-96008 nondimensional, other CGs
-> shifted with Cmα(x_cg) = Cmα(x_ref) + CLα (x_cg - x_ref)). Acceptance: Cmα (back-calculated from ωn²) within ± 25 % of
the source band at subsonic Mach; damping (Mq + Mα̇ from 2ζωn) within ± 20 %; supersonic documented (no Mach knob).
Back-calculation: ωn² = -Mα + (Lα/V)(-Mq), Mα = q̄Sc̄ Cmα/Iy, Mq = q̄Sc̄ Cmq (c̄/2V)/Iy, Lα/V = q̄ S CLα/(m V);
Iy ≈ 63 000 slug ft² (58 611 empty + fuel + pilot), Cmq from CR-96008 (-8.03 subsonic, -6.83 at M 1.36).

## Analysis (2b) - change 1: aero_center_lift 0 -> +3.6 ft (wing lift point forward)
- SDK (`docs/sdk-ref/flight_model.cfg.md`): aero_center_lift = longitudinal position of the aerodynamic centre (ft,
  relative to the model origin = our datum), used to place the wing surfaces once at start; all pitch-moment Mach tables
  are legacy (unused) -> no Mach-dependent knob. No downwash parameter. The tail sets Cmα AND Cmq (Cmq_tail ≈ -2 x 4.1 x
  0.246 x (19.0/9.55)² = -7.9 = CR-96008 -8.03) -> lowering elevator_lift_coef would also remove the (correct) damping.
- Missing physics = downwash at the tail (ΔCmα = a_t V_H dε/dα, ∝ CLα_wing). Equivalent: wing lift point forward,
  ΔCmα = CLα_wing(M) Δx/c̄ - scales with the lift Mach table like the downwash does.
- CLα_wing ≈ CLα_total - a_t S_t/S = 4.4 - 1.0 = 3.4 (M 0.94). Target ΔCmα +1.3 -> Δx = 1.3/3.4 x 9.55 = **3.6 ft**.
- Predictions: A Cmα -1.14, ωn ≈ 5.3, ζ ≈ 0.23 (same 2ζωn 2.44); B -1.07, ωn ≈ 3.5 (F/C 6 3.53), ζ ≈ 0.17; D ≈ -1.45,
  ωn ≈ 5.6; takeoff speeds ≈ -2.3 -> -1.4. Trim gradient δ/α (T3-G) 1.07 -> ≈ 0.55. Worst case (wing share 4.4): A -0.75,
  still stable.
- Side effects to check (regression): T3-A lift (normalization; FULL restart), T3-G trim gradient (new expectation ≈ 0.5),
  S12 supersonic trim, AP positioning/ALT hold (MCP `position`), T3-D takeoff (srot stick schedule S_HOLD -6 600 for
  α 10.5° will need less stick; takeoff trim 5° must not lift off by itself), T3-L/F3 landing (flare), H2 APC (kicker =
  trim offset; α thresholds unchanged), B7 minimum speeds. Reported CG % MAC may change if MSFS references the MAC to it.
- Abort criteria in flight: as the tool (|Δα| > 4°); first flight after the restart = takeoff_test (watch rotation;
  abort/stop on the runway if the nose rises before vr).
- **First flight after the change (2026-11-03 decision): no air start possible** (MSFS 2024 cannot save/resume a flight in
  the air) -> `srot taxi` high-speed taxi build-up at idle up to nose-wheel lift-off: break-out stick vs. prediction (≈ half
  the old value), check that the 5° takeoff trim alone does not lift the nose; derive S_HOLD; takeoff; fine-tune S_HOLD
  in the air with stick_hold_test.py; then the SP points A-D.

## Change 1 - hazards, preconditions, go/no-go (fixed test sequence, 2026-11-04)
**Hazards** (cause -> effect -> minimising -> recovery):
1. Takeoff stick schedule tuned to the old stiffness -> over-rotation / tail strike / kicker after liftoff -> first run
   = `srot taxi` with `shold=-2000` (taxi ends at θ 2.5° or 165 kt) -> script: idle, active nose-down push, brakes.
   Prediction: wing lift 3.6 ft further forward ≈ +21 000 ft lb nose-up at 160 kt (≈ +3.7° stab) -> break-out ≈ 163 kt with
   stick ≈ -1 600 (was -5 159 at 166 kt); the 5° trim alone would need ≈ 190 kt; no liftoff possible in the taxi run
   (CL 1.11 needed at 160 kt / θ 5°).
2. 5° takeoff trim lifts the nose before vr -> uncommanded rotation -> watch θ in the taxi log before vr ->
   recovery: the taxi stop routine (push, idle, brakes); next step would be a lower takeoff trim (FM 5°: flag, not change).
3. MSFS AP flies by trim; a less stiff airframe changes its loop -> oscillation after `position` -> post.py checks AP/level
   at the end of every script -> recovery: AP off, wings level, re-position from level flight; sim PAUSE if divergent.
4. Prediction wrong in the other direction (wing share 4.4 instead of 3.4) -> Cmα ≈ -0.75, still stable; short period
   slower -> no hazard; if any test shows |α| growing without input -> abort (tool |Δα| > 4°).
5. APC kicker = trim offset based on the stick-to-stab mapping; α thresholds unchanged -> first kicker check later (H2
   regression), not part of the first flights.
**Preconditions**: selftest ALL OK after the restart (module 7.2, units, watchdog, weather); check_build after build_cfg;
FULL sim restart done (normalization; lift check T3-A follows); runway_start (trim 5°, flaps 15); refuel; wind < 3 kt.
**Order**: (a) taxi `takeoff_test.py <csv> 157 10.5 taxi shold=-2000`; (b) takeoff with S_HOLD from (a) (proportional to the
break-out stick); (c) stick_hold_test.py in the air (gear down, TAKEOFF flaps) -> S_HOLD for α 10.5°; (d) SP points A, B, D
with pitch_step_test.py; (e) regression list above.
**Postconditions**: taxi: post.py ground (stopped, idle); flights: post.py air.
**Go/no-go 2026-11-04: GO** for the cfg change (prediction + hazards written, worst case still stable); flights after the FULL restart in the order above, each step gated by its postcondition.
